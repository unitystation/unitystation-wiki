    <h1 id="high-risk-items">High Risk Items<a class="headerlink" href="#high-risk-items" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>So you’re an antagonist, maybe a traitor who needs to steal the <a href="../Nuclear-Authentication-Disk/">nuke disk</a>; maybe you’re a wizard who needs to swipe the captain’s whip. This page will tell you where to find items you need for that sweet green text and the people who may be using them.</p>
<h2 id="the-justitia">The Justitia<a class="headerlink" href="#the-justitia" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Fancy laser pistol. Can be found in the <a href="../../Roles/Security%20roles/Head-of-Security/">HoS</a>'s locker or on his person most of the time. It needs the proper keycard to be fired. Has 3 different fire modes; kill, disable, and stun. Wanted by <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Wizard/">wizards</a> and <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Traitor/">traitors</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-imperator">The Imperator<a class="headerlink" href="#the-imperator" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The other fancy laser pistol. Can be found in the <a href="../../Roles/Command%20roles/Captain/">Captain</a>'s locker or on his person most of the time. It also needs the proper keycard to be fired. Wanted by <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Wizard/">wizards</a> and <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Traitor/">traitors</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-chain-of-command">The Chain of Command<a class="headerlink" href="#the-chain-of-command" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A symbolic chain kept in the <a href="../../Roles/Command%20roles/Captain/">captain</a>'s office, on his person or in some rare occasions with the <a href="../../Roles/Service%20roles/Mime/">mime</a> for some reason. It is wanted by <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Wizard/">wizards</a>, <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Traitor/">traitors</a>, and the <a href="../../Roles/Service%20roles/Mime/">mime</a>. The <a href="../../Roles/Command%20roles/Captain/">captain</a> usually does not care about this item, and it is left in his office.</p>
<h2 id="the-advanced-magboots">The Advanced Magboots<a class="headerlink" href="#the-advanced-magboots" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Magnetic Boots found in the <a href="../../Roles/Engineering%20roles/Chief-Engineer/">chief engineer's</a> suit storage unit in their office. They work like every other pair of magboots but have no slowdown when turned on. They are wanted by <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Wizard/">wizards</a> and <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Traitor/">traitors</a>.</p>
<h2 id="plasma-sheets">Plasma Sheets<a class="headerlink" href="#plasma-sheets" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Very flammable material with unusual physical and chemical properties. It is used to power the plasma generator and radiation collectors in the engineering department, by cargo to fulfill the station's mission, and by science to make very neat equipment. It is wanted by <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Wizard/">wizards</a> and <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Traitor/">traitors</a>. It is the most demanded item in this list, but also the most common, since it can be mined by shaft miners and the crew in various locations.</p>
<h2 id="the-ablative-trenchcoat">The Ablative Trenchcoat<a class="headerlink" href="#the-ablative-trenchcoat" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>An experimental trenchcoat that provides high resistance to energy and laser weapons. Kept in the Armory or in the Warden's locker. Wanted by <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Wizard/">wizards</a> and <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Traitor/">traitors</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-hypospray">The Hypospray<a class="headerlink" href="#the-hypospray" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>An Advanced injection device. Kept in the <a href="Chief-Medical-officer.md">CMO's</a> Office. Wanted by <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Wizard/">wizards</a> and <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Traitor/">traitors</a>.</p>
<h2 id="secret-documents">Secret Documents<a class="headerlink" href="#secret-documents" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Kept in a folder in the vault, but secret documents can also rarely be found in other peculiar locations. The documents are what is important, the folder they are kept in isn't needed.</p>
<h2 id="the-nuke-disk">The Nuke Disk<a class="headerlink" href="#the-nuke-disk" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="../Nuclear-Authentication-Disk/">nuke disk</a> is an item that spawns in the <a href="../../Roles/Command%20roles/Captain/">captain's</a> office. It is used to authenticate the activation of the on-station self destruct nuke as well as the syndicate nuke brought by the nuclear operatives.</p>
<p>With nuke disk pinpointers and a variety of antag roles specialized on taking this disk away, this is THE MOST risky item to have on your person. People interested in this item would be:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>1) [Nuke Ops](Nuclear%20Operative.md). The most consistent and a force to be reckoned with. Their objective is to use this item to blow up the station. They are well armed and have disk pinpointers.
2) [Wizards](../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Wizard.md). Very dangerous and consistent, very well armed with their spells and magic weapons, they present a big threat to the station. They most of the time don&#39;t have a disk pinpointer, but they have teleportation so beware.
3) [Traitors](../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Traitor.md). The least dangerous and somewhat inconsistent. They may be assigned to steal the disk and leave the station, which leaves them vulnerable to be killed while trying to leave.
4) [Death Squad](../Roles/Centcom%20roles/Death-Squad.md). *The most dangerous bar none,* but very inconsistent, as they only appear during admin events. They are BY FAR the most well equipped people you will find, and ARE NOT to be taken slightly. The best option is setting the escape shuttle to arrive in the least time possible and getting out ASAP. They have access to disk pinpointers.
5) The station command. Of course, the [Cap](../Roles/Command%20roles/Captain.md) is going to be on the lookout for the disk if its lost, so beware of him if you are an antag.
