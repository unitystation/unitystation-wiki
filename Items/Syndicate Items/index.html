<p>This is a comprehensive list of all items that <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Traitor/">Traitors</a> and <a href="../../Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Nuclear-Operative/">Nuclear Operatives</a> can purchase through their Syndicate uplink hidden on their PDAs. Shortly after round spawn, operatives and traitors will receive notifications telling them a code phrase to input into their PDAs in the ringtone configuration under settings. Traitors start with 20 Telecrystals (TC) while operatives start with 25 TC to spend on specialist equipment to complete their objectives.</p>

It can be configured to detonate on a timer (minimum time 10 seconds), or can be paired with a remote signaller to be remotely triggered. To pair it, simply click the remote signaller on the C4 brick and they are paired.</td>

<tr>
<td>Miniature Energy Crossbow</td>
<td>An (expensive) self charging and easily hideable pocket crossbow that stuns and poisons those it hits. Basically a discrete poison tazer. When fired, it does not leave a message in the chat that would give away your identity. This weapon desperately needs to be paired with another, as the damage and rate of fire are insufficient to kill anyone quickly, but the stun and quiet firing are immensely helpful in an ambush.</td>

<td>Various suits, typically of the spaceworthy variety.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Syndicate Spacesuit</td>
<td>A spacesuit that can be used similarly to other softsuits on the station. Despite being a softsuit, it is actually very protective, providing slightly better stats than standard security officer armor. while it's main utility is for Traitors, don't forget that as a nuclear operative, this is a good option if you plan to sneak aboard the station and adopt a disguise as it is small enough to fit inside a backpack, allowing you to keep it for when you need to go loud or escape the station.</td>

<td>Gadgets that don't fit in with others</td>

<td>1TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cryptographic Sequencer</td>
<td>Otherwise known as the Emag. It causes doors to open, and certain other machinery to malfunction. Generally, the effects of the Emag are permanent unless someone repairs the affected machines; For example, doors will stay permanently open until repaired. The effects of the Emag are powerful, but it does mean that you leave an obvious trail to follow if you are being pursued. The Emag has 5 regenerating charges, and you can see roughly how many you have left on the card's sprite. It regenerates one charge after 30 seconds.</td>
<td>6TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Surgical Equipment Bundle</td>
<td>Comes with all the tools for surgery in a conspicuous, red and black duffel bag.</td>
<td>3TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Combat Med Kit</td>
<td>A slightly larger than normal military first aid kit that comes with the basic medical consumables.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Full Syndicate Toolbox</td>
<td>A mechanical toolbox full of tools, but eviler. Small serrations on the exterior of the toolbox also give it slightly increased melee damage.</td>

<td>Syndicate Soap</td>
<td>Soap, but red, menacing. good for cleaning up any blood from your assassinations.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><font color="red"><strong>(POINTLESS) BADASSERY</strong></font></td>
<td>Useless fun, or with very niche or RP oriented uses.</td>

<td>20TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Briefcase Full of Cash</td>
<td>A Briefcase full of cash, need I say more?</td>
<td>1TC</td>

<tr>
<td>Stalker SMG</td>
<td>Your stock firepower, a .45 cal SMG with a 24 round capacity. Hits pretty hard and comes with a syndicate electronic firing pin, which prevents enemies from using it. Additional magazines are pretty affordable, making this the obvious budget option (no price better than free!).</td>
<td>10TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bulldozer shotgun</td>
<td>A drum-fed shotgun with a decent rate of fire. It accepts many different ammunition types, but the standard buckshot load is perhaps the deadliest one available to you.</td>
<td>8TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>M90-gl carbine</td>
<td>A strange 5.56 carbine with a high rate of fire and a currently non-functional under-barrel grenade launcher. Unremarkable without that grenade launcher, unfortunately, save for a very peculiar optional ammo type; 5.56 Phasic ammo. This ammo currently has some of the high armor penetration of any weapon in the game at 70%. Sadly, you can't get it with the carbine without declaring war or getting a fellow operative to donate 1TC to you.</td>
<td>18TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Buzzsaw LMG</td>
<td>High capacity pain. This LMG fires fast, hits like a truck at 40 damage a bullet, and holds 50 rounds per magazine, making it one of the nastiest weapons available to you, especially if you invest in some of the alternate ammo types.</td>
<td>18TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Migraine .50 cal sniper rifle</td>
<td>A slow firing sniper rifle. You might think it strange to bring a sniper with you on a space station assault, but it has a few qualities that are quite valuable. First, it's standard ammunition deals 70 damage a shot and is inherently armor piercing, reducing armor by 50%. Second, it has a very high bullet velocity, making it hard to dodge. Third, it stuns targets for a brief moment. All of these qualities makes it a very effective ambush weapon.</td>

<td>10TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Toy SMG</td>
<td>A toy stalker that fires donksoft darts</td>
<td>5TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Surplus Rifle</td>
<td>A cheap piece of trash that isn't particularly effective, but for the TC spent, It provides some value. Your free stalker is <em>signficantly</em> more effective and it's free, though, so don't buy this unless you're looking to meme around.</td>
<td>2TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stechkin APS machine Pistol</td>
<td>An automatic 9mm pistol. Similar overall effectiveness to the Makarov at a higher price, but definitely more fun to use.</td>
<td>10TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>84mm Rocket Launcher</td>
<td>A reloadable rocket launcher preloaded with an 84mm HE rocket grenade. With a very large blast radius, a potent weapon versus crowds. the alternate HEDP rocket also has utility for  taking out heavily armored targets.</td>
<td>8TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Biohazardous chemical Sprayer</td>
<td>A currently semi-functional tool. Chemicals are in an awkward state, balance wise, so this item isn't recommended for use just yet.</td>
<td>20TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><font color="red">AMMUNITION</font></strong></td>
<td>Ammo for Operative exclusive weapons</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12g buckshot drum</td>
<td>Powerful, and the spread makes it hard to dodge. Two full volleys of buckshot will down an unarmored target, but your average <a href="security-officer.md">Security Officer</a> will take three.</td>
<td>2TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12g Dragons Breath drum</td>
<td>the <em>fun</em> option. fires 4 low-damage flaming projectiles. A great option for sowing panic. While you are unlikely to drop people with dragon's breath, you will definitely distract them, and likely force a retreat so they can put themselves out. Repeatedly shooting people with dragon's breath isn't a very effective use of the ammo as a single shell will apply 4 firestacks to them, and characters can only receive 5 firestacks at a given time. Since they can't put themselves out, a single shell will eventually burn a critted player to death if they don't have any fire protection, as the damage potential is over 100.</td>
<td>2TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12g slug drum</td>
<td>Fires a single slug that deals slightly less total damage than buckshot, but has 20% armor penetration and a higher projectile velocity, so if you are facing armored targets or are fighting over distance, consider picking this.</td>
<td>3TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>.45 Magazine</td>
<td>An extra magazine for the stalker SMG. Grab a few of these if you plan to stick with it.</td>
<td>3TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>.45 Magazine Incendiary</td>
<td>Like other incendiary ammunition, this magazine deals half normal damage in exchange for igniting the target on fire. The stalker doesn't have a lot of synergy with incendiary ammunition, but it isn't a strictly bad purchase either, and it's cheap.</td>
<td>4TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>.45 Magazine AP</td>
<td>The stalker <em>does</em> have a lot of synergy with AP ammunition. If you know you are going to deal with a station prepared for your arrival or if you expect to encounter <a href="../../Roles/Centcom%20roles/Redshield-Officer/">Unusually</a> <a href="../../Roles/Centcom%20roles/Emergency-Response-Team/">Tough</a> <a href="../../Roles/Centcom%20roles/Death-Squad/">Resistance,</a> since you get the stalker for free, this is a very cost effective way to get 50% armor penetration in an automatic package.</td>
<td>5TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7.12 Box Magazine</td>
<td>More lead for the buzzsaw. Useful if the station is well populated or if you plan to use the buzzsaw as a literal saw to cut through windows and walls.</td>
<td>6TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7.12 AP Box Magazine</td>
<td>Expensive, but if you are going against a full squad of <a href="../../Roles/Centcom%20roles/Death-Squad/">the best and baddest,</a> accept no substitutes.</td>
<td>9TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7.12 Incendiary Box Magazine</td>
<td>This paired with the Elite Syndicate Hardsuit is a contender for one of the most cancerous weapon-ammo-armor combos in the game. The buzzsaw deals so much damage per shot that the half-damage penalty for incendiary ammo isn't as significant as with other weapons, and lighting people on fire creates a significant problem for them to deal with while they fight you.</td>
<td>6TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>.50 Sniper Magazine</td>
<td>With the low bullet count per magazine, you will probably have to buy a few of these (or better yet, buy the sniper bundle). Don't forget that this has 50% armor penetration as standard.</td>
<td>4TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>.50 Penetrator Sniper Magazine</td>
<td>Doesn't currently go through targets like it's supposed to, but it does have somewhat better AP qualities over the standard magazine.</td>
<td>5TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5.56 Magazine</td>
<td>Nothing remarkable when compared to the stock stalker you get. If you are going for the carbine, then you want to look at the variant below.</td>
<td>4TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5.56 Magazine Phasic</td>
<td>the cost is high, but so it the armor penetration. At 70% armor pen, this ammo destroys armored targets. It also has unusual projectile properties that can be advantageous.</td>
<td>8TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>40mm Grenade Rounds Box</td>
<td>without access to a grenade launcher, pass on this for now.</td>
<td>6TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>84mm HE Rocket</td>
<td>a high damage, wide blast area rocket. Use versus crowds. Also ensure that you have a space suit on because it will definitely punch a hole through the station.</td>
<td>4TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>84mm HEDP Rocket</td>
<td>Doesn't have a very good use case (yet!). It does have high AP effects on the rocket's impact point, but because most of its damage is bomb damage, it's not even very good against centcom forces.</td>
<td>6TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9mm stechkin Pistol Magazine</td>
<td>15 round magazine for the fancy 9mm sidearm.</td>
<td>2TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Riot Dart Box</td>
<td>ammo for the dart guns.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><font color="red"><strong>EXPLOSIVES</strong></font></td>
<td>Operative exclusive explosive items, used for AOE damage or destruction of important objects.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grenadier's Belt</td>
<td>Very expensive, but if you are planning to buy a lot of grenades, this belt provides good savings. Comes with 2 minibombs, 6 grenades, 2 EMP grenades, a multitool, and an evil screwdriver.</td>
<td>24TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>EMP grenade box</td>
<td>A box full of 7 EMP grenades. If you want to cause chaos on the station without blowing holes in it, this kit is a good option.</td>
<td>10TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><font color="red"><strong>SUITS</strong></font></td>
<td>Various suits, typically of the spaceworthy variety.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blood-Red Magboots</td>
<td>For when you don't like the pair you start with for some reason.</td>
<td>2TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elite Syndicate Hardsuit</td>
<td>an upgrade over your standard blood red hardsuit, this suit's utility isn't derived from extra protection from laser and bullets (it's a bit better than the standard suit, but actually has slightly weaker laser protection). Instead, you get this for the enhanced protection to environmental damages, such as bomb, fire, and acid damage. This is a great choice if you are at risk of damaging yourself with your own AOE weaponry.</td>
<td>8TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><font color="red"><strong>MISC. GADGETS</strong></font></td>
<td>Gadgets that dont fit in with others</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jaws of Life</td>
<td>A handy power tool that can act as both a crowbar and wirecutters. It's main utility is that while in crowbar mode, it can force open <em>powered</em> airlocks, allowing you to force through any doors in your way. Do note that it's a bit loud when it does so, though, and it can't force open bolted doors, so a watchful <a href="../../Roles/Synthetic%20roles/Station-AI/">AI</a> can stall your progress.</td>
<td>4TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Syndicate Reinforcement</td>
<td>This option buys you a small transponder that when activated opens a ghost role that lets one dead player spawn as an extra Nuclear Operative. They start with all the stock equipment, but <em>no TC of their own,</em> so you've got to share with them to get them equipped. That, combined with the price of this option means this item is really only viable if you've declared war on the station for extra TC.</td>
<td>25TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><font color="red"><strong>BUNDLES</strong></font></td>
<td>Think of the savings!</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bioterror bundle</td>
<td>Currently not worth getting as chemistry is underdeveloped. 12 TC saved.</td>
<td>30TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bulldozer bundle</td>
<td>Comes with a Bulldozer shotgun, a 12g <em>stun</em> slug drum and buckshot drum. Stun slugs are a useful way to get stuns if you need to take someone alive for one reason or another. Saves you 3TC</td>
<td>13TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stalker bundle</td>
<td>A duffel bag that comes with a stalker with a supressor and an AP magazine and an Incendiary magazine. It saves you 7TC, but since nukies already start with a stalker, really, it's -3TC. This mainly has utility under the very specific circumstances of when you need to arm another person for whatever reason.</td>
<td>15TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sniper bundle</td>
<td>A briefcase that comes with a Migraine, two spare magazines, and a worn out suit and tie. Saves you 6TC</td>
<td>20TC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Spetznas Pyro Bundle</td>
<td>comes with an elite syndicate hardsuit, a stechkin pistol, 2 magazines of stechkin incendiary ammo, a minibomb, and vodka. Not very effective, but definitely fun.</td>
