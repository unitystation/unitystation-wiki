# Guide to Food and Cooking

## Understanding Nutrition =

In Unitystation, every character has a nutrition value that determines how full their stomach is. The nutrition value goes from 1 to 500, and every character has 400 nutrition at the start of a round. You will receive different messages in the chat log and possibly effects depending on how much nutrition you have.

- 500 Nutrition: "You're stuffed!", you won't be able to eat any more food at this point.
- 300 Nutrition: "You're satiated.", no effect.
- 200 Nutrition: "You feel hungry.", no effect.
- 100 Nutrition: "Your stomach rumbles violently.", no effect.
- 000 Nutrition: "Your malnourished body aches!", you start to slow down!

You will gradually lose nutrition over time, though different actions cause different amounts of nutrition loss. Running around will cause you to go hungrier faster than walking around or staying still.
