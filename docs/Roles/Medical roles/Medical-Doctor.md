## Overview

Medics are arguably the most vital role to a thriving station, except for [Security](Security.md) and [Command](Captain.md). Their job is to heal any injured people, clone dead crew members, and provide the kitchen with dead bodies when other food sources run out.


While it's not a required part of the role, it should be noted that non-[antagonist](Antagonist.md) Medical Officers are generally expected to do no harm unless your own life or the life of an innocent is at stake; Your purpose is to preserve human life above all else. This doesn't mean you can't make people harm themselves or make other people do the harm for you, but it means that your most efficient tool to fight is running away. Screaming is a close second.


### Don't worry, ribs grow back!


Playing a Medical Doctor is a hell of a job. 80% of the time nothing is happening. You're just pacing back and forth, filling out inane paperwork, slapping bandaids on assistants who electrocuted themselves trying to open doors they aren't supposed to be accessing, just waiting for shit to happen. The remaining 20% of the job is the most desperate struggle to ward off the oncoming, unstoppable advances of death incarnate.'' All is quiet until suddenly, [something](Events.md) happens and half the station is dead or dying. Bodies begin piling up at the front door, some crying in pain, others very ''very dead. No one can tell you how any of these people died or got hurt, they just found them. You buckle down and begin treatment as fast as you can, rapidly blazing through bruise packs and ointment. Some are rescued but others are getting worse and worse. You begin having to make decisions on who lives and who dies as the numbers needing CPR triple those that can give it.    

It's all very rewarding and dramatic, until you realize that you can just let everyone die and clone them instantly, saving oodles of time, resources, and effort. Derp.


###  *Whispers* no they don't


Well, besides all that, let's get into the art of treatment and diagnosis. So the first thing you need to know is that all characters have 100 health, but health can go negative down to -100. While a character is above 0 health, they are conscious and functioning. Once they go below 0, they are in critical condition, only able to crawl around very slowly and talk quietly. While in critical condition they also begin to suffocate, taking -1 health from oxygen loss per second. At -25 health, they cannot move or speak any more. at -100 they are dead.

So how do you heal hurt people? Well, Medics have access to first aid kits and burn treatment kits, which come with everything you need to treat 95% of injuries encountered (at the moment. Surgery 1.0 will change this when it comes out). The first must-have-at-all-times is the health scanner. It's a tool that when used on a patient, tells you all accumulated damage broken down by type and by body part, allowing you to assess how to proceed with treatment.

'Brute' damage is the most commonly seen type. It is from physical trauma, such as bullets to the chest and toolboxes to the head, as well as damage from low or high pressure environments, such as the vacuum of space. Brute damage is treated with bruise packs. These are found in first aid kits, the medical vending machine, as well as medical life-saver belts. You will typically run through quite a few of these, so refills will probably be necessary from time to time. Bruise packs heal 40 brute damage per use, but only will heal damage on the body part treated, so you will typically waste a lot of the healing potential of each pack as wounds tend to be scattered across the body rather than localized in one spot.

The second main source of damage is 'Burn' damage. This is mostly caused from fires and energy weapons, such as energy carbines and light sabres. It shows up, but not as frequently as brute damage. Burn damage is treated with ointment. Typically, you will find that first aid kits are over-provisioned with burn ointment, and you should replace a stack with bruise packs. Burn treatment kits are also a thing, but they are mega overkill for most situations except mass-casualty incidents like station-wide plasma fires. Each ointment use heals 40 burn damage.

The third most common damage type is 'oxygen loss** (called **OxyLoss'), which is more of a symptom of other damage than it is its own damage type. Oxygen damage is accumulated when a character is deprived of oxygen (from space or through station [atmosphere tampering](Atmospherics-technician.md)) or when they are in critical condition (0 health or less). It behaves exactly like any other damage, but accumulates at a rate of 1 per second. While a person is above 0 health, you can treat OxyLoss just by making sure they apply their internals or bringing them to an oxygenated environment (a place with at least 20% oxygen). Once a patient is in critical condition, however, they lose the ability to breath on their own, so you must apply CPR. 

CPR is done by clicking on the patient with an empty hand on help intent while they are adjacent to you. CPR takes 5 seconds to be performed, and while you are doing it, the patient stops taking OxyLoss. Once you have completed a round of CPR, the patient's oxygen damage is healed by 2. This means that in order to bring someone out of critical, you may have to perform CPR **a lot** to get the job done. Another important note is that CPR will not treat the victim's other injuries, so if a patient is at -30 damage from brute and burn sources alone, no amount of CPR will stabilize them until their wounds are treated. This is where help from other medical personnel or even passers-by can be indespensible. Having someone else performing CPR while you diagnose and treat will greatly increase the odds of survival for the patient, especially if there are multiple patients in critical condition.

The last damage type currently in game is toxin damage which is only accumulated from radiation poisoning. (This shit is brand new and doesn't quite work how it used to, so idk how to treat it. The charcoal pills don't seem to have an effect, so good luck. If they die, just clone them.)


###  Imitation Meat


So let's say you've applied what you know as a professional medical practitioner and your patient still died. Or maybe someone just found a cold stiffy shoved in a locker in maintenance. What do you do then?

Well, you clone them, of course. Cloning is the ultimate mulligan. It can be done over and over as long as you've got a body to clone. When a character dies, take them to the cloning room and put them in the DNA scanner. This can be done by click-and-dragging their body into the DNA scanner while they are adjacent to it. once they are in and the scanner is shut, go to the cloning console and hit the scan button to create a DNA record. Once you've got their record, navigate to it and hit clone. If the player has not left the server, then it will start cloning their body. Cloning is really fast, only taking 10~15 seconds. Once they are cloned, make sure to pull their old body out of the scanner so they can re-equip their old gear.

When it comes to the intersection between cloning and role-playing; it is generally assumed that a clone <u>does not</u> know how exactly they died or, if they were murdered, who did it. Their memory will be foggy and unclear, and they may have some confusion when it comes to understanding that they are a clone. Treat them with a polite sensitivity and ask them how they feel.

Note that the one critical flaw of the cloning process is that it requires a corpse in the first place; one that has not been too chewed up, as well. If the body is lost in space, gibbed by explosions, butchered by the [chef](Cook.md), or taken extensive enough fire damage as to be turned into a husk, then they cannot be cloned. One preventative measure that can be taken against this outcome is to scan high-risk people (or really any takers) in the DNA scanner in advance. It's also a good idea at round start to take turns with the rest of the medical staff scanning each other just in case something happens. You might think you are perfectly safe being stationed in the department that has the cloner, but you'd be surprised what could happen.
###  Medical Modus Operandi


Not sure what to do? Here's a handy set of operations that you can follow:

1) Heal critically injured crew members that are around medbay. They are the top priority. Dead people waiting to be cloned can wait a little longer. There is no heavy risk in doing this activity since people often have other priorities over killing you when they haven't died yet.

2) Clone dead people that were brought to you by another crew member. NEVER go find bodies on your own, as you might accidentally end up reviving a filthy [antagonist](Antagonist.md) that puts you into a box and throws you out an airlock. It also might not be a bad idea to ask [Security](Security.md) if any dead to-be-clones that you get have any outstanding criminal charges.

3) Do in-the-field medical attention. Sometimes you need to go to the action to save your plasma burned crew mates, it's recommended to bring additional medical supplies so you can dole them out to other responders if the situation's bad enough.

4) Heal random dudes. When someone arrives at medbay and says he's injured, you should try to help them, but not without doing some extremely unnecessary paperwork, you know, to keep the [Captain](Captain.md) happy. You might as well do check-ups in the halls on the way to lunch, too.

5) Check on [the](Assistant.md) [prisoners](Clown.md) in the brig and the [security officers](Security-officer.md) themselves. [Security](Security.md) tends to be a hotspot for injuries, and its also an opportunity to flex on [shitcurity](Shitsec.md) for human rights abuse, maybe even inspiring them to [change their ways](So-close-to-impossible-that-it-might-as-well-not-even-exist.md). [Lawyers](Lawyer.md) will love you for this.

6) Open up the cloning bay for everyone to come get pre-emptively scanned just in case. Brings a whole new meaning to life insurance.
